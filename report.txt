Title: Smart Water Consumption Prediction using XGBoost

Approach:
We approached this regression problem using the XGBoost algorithm, known for its performance and ability to handle both linear and non-linear relationships. We applied proper preprocessing and feature engineering to maximize predictive power.

Tools Used:
- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- XGBoost (xgboost)
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

Feature Engineering:
- Parsed the Timestamp field into multiple temporal features:
  - Hour of the day
  - Day of the month
  - Month of the year
  - Weekday (0=Monday, 6=Sunday)
- Dropped the original timestamp field after extracting features.
- Handled missing values using `SimpleImputer`:
  - Mean imputation for numerical fields
  - Most frequent imputation for categorical fields
- One-hot encoding of categorical variables

Model:
- XGBoost Regressor with:
  - `n_estimators=200`
  - `learning_rate=0.05`
  - `random_state=42`
- Trained using a pipeline with preprocessing steps included.

Output:
- `submission_xag.csv` containing the predictions of water consumption.
